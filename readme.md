# PORTFOLIO
## First steps in this ongoing project
This website was created from scratch, and will function as a ongoing project to further develop my skills as a web Developer.  This will be a showcase of my coding portfolio.  Originally I have been planning on incorporating this into my pre existing [website](https://www.Lelandbyrd.com) - and hope to continue to use this code as I further progress into my coding bootcamp class.
## Wordpress incorporation
At first, I have been working with my personal website and created a page called "portfolio-coding".  I ran into some issues with word press CSS styling overiding my scratch code and employed the following methods to start from scratch within my wordpress site. 
- installed a plugin on wordpress to use multiple themes
- used a theme called "blankSlate" to have this webpage attempt to start from scratch
- installed a widget context plugin to attempt to get rid of widgets on one page in wordpress
## Immediate Actions Taken to submit for Homework
Since I am planning on using this homework assingment as a tool within my own website, I have realized I am not taking into perspective the immediate goal of submitting the required work.  I plan to come back to these step in the wordpress site, but will press on to get these files deployed to gitHub pages in the mean time.
## Back to the Task at Hand
